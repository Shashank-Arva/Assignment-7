Summary - In this ICP, the code is focused on improving model performance by adjusting hyperparameters and making architectural changes. Initially, the logistic regression model undergoes tuning using grid search to find the optimal regularization parameter, resulting in improved validation accuracy. Additionally, the code utilizes visualizations such as pair plots and box plots to gain insights into data distribution. Following this, a modified neural network is introduced, incorporating multiple dense layers with ReLU activation functions to achieve higher accuracy. The script concludes by conducting comprehensive evaluations, including testing accuracy, confusion matrix analysis, loss and accuracy plots, ROC curve examination, and feature importance visualization, ensuring a thorough assessment of the model's performance and behavior.
